# Pygmalion Effect 
```
According to Pygmalion Effect people's expectation from us can influence our own expectations and performance. This means people influence our performance directly with their belief about us. For example, if our boss share that they trust us about a project, tell us that they know we`ll do amazing, then we actually put an extra effort to show them that they`re right about us. Unfortunately this self-fullfilling effect works in both ways, therefore once we get into a negative environment with people with low expectations from us, we`re bound to make mistakes and underperform.

Cycle of Pygmalion Effect
1. People have a certain belief about us.
2. Beliefs affect our own beliefs about ourselves.
3. Our beliefs about ourselves affect our behaviours. 
4. And people`s beliefs about us get confirmed by our behaviours and performance. 
5. Cycle starts again and goes on and on.

Pygmalion Effect comes from a Greek man sculpture Pygmalion who fell in love with the sculpture he carved. The sculpture he made was so realistic that he wanted to find a wife just as beautiful like her, Aphrodite ,Greek Goddess of Love, heard his wish and sculpture came alive with the kiss of Pygmalion. Just like Pygmalion, what we focus and believe shape and comes to life. therefore we need to be careful with our own thoughts about ourselves and how other people`s thoughts shape us.
