#### [[Map Of Content]]

---

Rather than Nested folder hierarchies as a taxonomy for notes and knowledge a Map of Content is akin to an index, roots branching off into more granular levels of detail. like Dendrites of neurons branching out.

This allows tendrils of topics to branch out before venturing into granularity of individual notes. 

This organic structure in organization rather than a synthetic classification of folders mimics not only the structures in the brain, but also the way in which knowledge is formed and organized within the brain.

Another way of utilizing the soft links of tags rather than the traditional approach of "shotgun metadata" is to use them to not group regardless of context, rather group by similar context of status^[[[Tag Taxonomy]]] such as "in processing" or "completed".
