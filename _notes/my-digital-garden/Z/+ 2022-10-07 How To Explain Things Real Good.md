**Notes**
[4:59](https://youtu.be/b-M2U3Jl1Cg?t=299)  
*Tell them why you care, not why they should care.*
- Show what made you care and why are you interested in something, don’t tell why your audience should care.
[7:04](https://youtu.be/b-M2U3Jl1Cg?t=424)  
*Show and tell.* 
Start with a concrete example and then go with the abstract definition or ideas. In their example, Nicky shows a long definition of group theorem from Wikipedia page. After that they show an analogy through chess pieces to explain group theorem, for someone who has no clue about the theorem the concrete example gives them a starting point.

PEA acronym works to help you show and tell.
- Pictures
- Examples
- Analogy

Show a picture, then tell.  
Show an example, then tell.

*Therefore & But > not and then*  
Stories need to be consequential to make sense to our audience. Try to connect everything you are explaining with each other.

Example Nicky showed was about a young guy gains superpowers and then another old guy dies. In this story there is no sequential situation, they don’t feel related at all. A random guy dying has nothing to do with our story opener. 

But in the other story where Nicky mentions Spider-Man, he first gets fired from work, and a spider bite him, therefore he seeks power, but his greedy side causes him to lose his Uncle Ben therefore he seeks redemption through saving people.

Nicky also uses a gif to explain how piano key creates sound, in that story piano key pressed first, but if you pressed it long enough you can’t make sound, therefore engineers added an extra hammer to keep the sound happening. (Therefore&but stories are everywhere.)

*Cut %10 percent of your first draft.*
- They're most likely to be fluff and not needed.
[14:37](https://youtu.be/b-M2U3Jl1Cg?t=877)  
*Test early&often.* 
- Don't wait long enough for people to see, show them early and reiterate.
