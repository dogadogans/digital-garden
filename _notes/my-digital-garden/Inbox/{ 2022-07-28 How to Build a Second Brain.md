## Notes:

- **Section 2 What Is a Second Brain?**
	- In past centuries, only the intellectual elite needed commonplace books‚Äîwriters, politicians, philosophers, and scientists who had a reason to synthesize their writing or research. Nowadays, almost everyone needs a way to manage information. More than half the workforce today can be considered ‚Äúknowledge workers‚Äù‚Äîprofessionals for whom knowledge is their most valuable asset, and who spend a majority of their time managing large amounts of information. In addition, no matter what our formal role is, all of us have to come up with new ideas, solve novel problems, and communicate with others effectively. We have to do these things regularly, reliably, not just once in a while.
	
	- For centuries, artists and intellectuals from Leonardo da Vinci to Virginia Woolf, from John Locke to Octavia Butler, have recorded the ideas they found most interesting in a book they carried around with them, known as a ‚Äúcommonplace book.‚Äù
	
	- Commonplace books were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of knowledge from different sources and to inspire their own thinking.


- This digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas. It is a multipurpose tool that can adapt to your changing needs over time. In school or courses you take, it can be used to take notes for studying. At work, it can help you organize your projects. At home, it can help you manage your household.

In the old days, people who are the

- **Section 3 How a Second Brain Works**

- There are four essential capabilities that we can rely on a Second Brain to perform for us: Making our ideas concrete. Revealing new associations between ideas. Incubating our ideas over time. Sharpening our unique perspectives.


- Every time we turn on our smartphone or computer, we are immediately immersed in the flow of juicy content they present. Much of this information is useful and interesting‚Äîhow-to articles that could make us more productive, podcasts with experts sharing hard-won lessons, or inspiring photos of travel destinations we might want to visit. Here‚Äôs the problem: we can‚Äôt consume every bit of this information stream. We will quickly be exhausted and overwhelmed if we try. We need to adopt the perspective of a curator, stepping back from the raging river and starting to make intentional decisions about what information we want to fill our minds. Like a scientist capturing only the rarest butterflies to take back to the lab, our goal should be to ‚Äúcapture‚Äù only the ideas and insights we think are truly noteworthy. Content tends to pile up all around us even without our involvement. There are probably emails filling your inbox, updates popping up in your social media feeds, and notifications proliferating on your smartphone as you‚Äôre reading this.


- I‚Äôm here to tell you that that is no way to live your life. Information becomes knowledge ‚Äîpersonal, embodied, verified‚Äîonly when we put it to use. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do, it‚Äôs just a theory. This is why I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating.‚Ä† We all naturally have a desire to create‚Äîto bring to life something good, true, or beautiful. 9 It‚Äôs a part of our essential nature. Creating new things is not only one of the most deeply fulfilling things we can do, it can also have a positive impact on others‚Äîby inspiring, entertaining, or educating them.



- While your Second Brain is made up of all the tools you use to interact with information, including a to-do list, a calendar, email, and reading apps, for example, there is one category of software I recommend as the centerpiece of your Second Brain: a digital notetaking app.* There are plentiful options available, from the free notes app that came preinstalled on your smartphone to third-party software you can download with exactly the features you need.


- **Capture- Keep What Resonates

- As you start collecting this material from the outer world, it often sparks new ideas and realizations in your inner world. You can capture those thoughts too! They could include: Stories: Your favorite anecdotes, whether they happened to you or someone else.


- Insights: The small (and big) realizations you have. Memories: Experiences from your life that you don‚Äôt want to forget. Reflections: Personal thoughts and lessons written in a journal or diary. Musings: Random ‚Äúshower ideas‚Äù that pop into your head.


- There is a way out of this situation. It starts with realizing that in any piece of content, the value is not evenly distributed . There are always certain parts that are especially interesting, helpful, or valuable to you. When you realize this, the answer is obvious. You can extract only the most salient, relevant, rich material and save it as a succinct note. Don‚Äôt save entire chapters of a book‚Äîsave only select passages. Don‚Äôt save complete transcripts of interviews‚Äîsave a few of the best quotes. Don‚Äôt save entire websites‚Äîsave a few screenshots of the sections that are most interesting


- Writing creates new knowledge that wasn‚Äôt there before. Each word you write triggers mental cascades and internal associations, leading to further ideas, all of which can come tumbling out onto the page or screen.* Thinking doesn‚Äôt just produce writing; writing also enriches thinking.


- Everything not saved will be lost. ‚ÄîNintendo ‚ÄúQuit Screen‚Äù message


- Highlights: Insightful passages from books or articles you read. Quotes: Memorable passages from podcasts or audiobooks you listen to. Bookmarks and favorites: Links to interesting content you find on the web or favorited social media posts. Voice memos: Clips recorded on your mobile device as ‚Äúnotes to self.‚Äù Meeting notes: Notes you take about what was discussed during meetings or phone calls. Images: Photos or other images that you find inspiring or interesting. Takeaways: Lessons from courses, conferences, or presentations you‚Äôve attended.

 - External knowledge


- In other words, Feynman‚Äôs approach was to maintain a list of a dozen open questions. When a new scientific finding came out, he would test it against each of his questions to see if it shed any new light on the problem. This cross-disciplinary approach allowed him to make connections across seemingly unrelated subjects, while continuing to follow his sense of curiosity.


- Ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat are the questions I‚Äôve always been interested in?‚Äù This could include grand, sweeping questions like ‚ÄúHow can we make society fairer and more equitable?‚Äù as well as practical ones like ‚ÄúHow can I make it a habit to exercise every day?‚Äù It might include questions about relationships, such as ‚ÄúHow can I have closer relationships with the people I love?‚Äù or productivity, like ‚ÄúHow can I spend more of my time doing high-value work?‚Äù
Question ideal



- The power of your favorite problems is that they tend to stay fairly consistent over time. The exact framing of each question may change, but even as we move between projects, jobs, relationships, and careers, our favorite problems tend to follow us across the years. I recommend asking your family or childhood friends what you were obsessed with as a kid. Those very same interests probably still fire your imagination as an adult.



- Ask people close to you what you were obsessed with as a child (often you‚Äôll continue to be fascinated with the same things as an adult). Don‚Äôt worry about coming up with exactly twelve (the exact number doesn‚Äôt matter, but try to come up with at least a few). Don‚Äôt worry about getting the list perfect



- The renowned information theorist Claude Shannon, whose discoveries paved the way for modern technology, had a simple definition for ‚Äúinformation‚Äù: that which surprises you. 7 If you‚Äôre not surprised, then you already knew it at some level, so why take note of it? Surprise is an excellent barometer for information that doesn‚Äôt fit neatly into our existing understanding, which means it has the potential to change how we think.



- Besides capturing what personally resonates with you, there are a couple other kinds of details that are generally useful to save in your notes. It‚Äôs a good idea to capture key information about the source of a note, such as the original web page address, the title of the piece, the author or publisher, and the date it was published.* Many capture tools are even able to identify and save this information automatically. Also, it‚Äôs often helpful to capture chapter titles, headings, and bullet-point lists, since they add structure to your notes and represent distillation already performed by the author on your behalf.



- First, you are much more likely to remember information you‚Äôve written down in your own words. Known as the ‚ÄúGeneration Effect,‚Äù 10 researchers have found that when people actively generate a series of words, such as by speaking or writing, more parts of their brain are activated when compared to simply reading the same words. Writing things down is a way of ‚Äúrehearsing‚Äù those ideas, like practicing a dance routine or shooting hoops, which makes them far more likely to stick.


- If you‚Äôre looking for a more precise answer of how much content to capture in your notes, I recommend no more than 10 percent of the original source, at most. Any more than that, and it will be too difficult to wade through all the material in the future. Conveniently, 10 percent also happens to be the limit that most ebooks allow you to export as highlights.


- **Section 5 Organize - Save for Actionability**

- This order gives us a convenient checklist for deciding where to put a note, starting at the top of the list and moving down: In which project will this be most useful? If none : In which area will this be most useful? If none : Which resource does this belong to? If none : Place in archives.


- ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one final benefit to the box: It gives you a chance to look back. A lot of people don‚Äôt appreciate this. When they‚Äôre done with a project, they‚Äôre relieved. They‚Äôre ready for a break and then they want to move forward to the next idea. The box gives you the opportunity to reflect on your performance. Dig down through the boxes archaeologically and you‚Äôll see a project‚Äôs beginnings. This can be instructive. How did you do? Did you get to your goal? Did you improve on it? Did it change along the way? Could you have done it all more efficiently?‚Äù


- There‚Äôs a name for this phenomenon: the Cathedral Effect. 2 Studies have shown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking. When we are in a space with high ceilings, for example‚Äîthink of the lofty architecture of classic churches invoking the grandeur of heaven‚Äîwe tend to think in more abstract ways. When we‚Äôre in a room with low ceilings, such as a small workshop, we‚Äôre more likely to think concretely.


- PARA can handle it all, regardless of your profession or field, for one reason: it organizes information based on how actionable it is , not what kind of information it is . The project becomes the main unit of organization for your digital files. Instead of having to sort your notes according to a complex hierarchy of topics and subtopics, you have to answer only one simple question: ‚ÄúIn which project will this be most useful?‚Äù It assumes only that you are currently working on a certain set of projects, and that your information should be organized to support them.


- Projects have a couple of features that make them an ideal way to organize modern work. First, they have a beginning and an end; they take place during a specific period of time and then they finish. Second, they have a specific, clear outcome that needs to happen in order for them to be checked off as complete, such as ‚Äúfinalize,‚Äù ‚Äúgreen-light,‚Äù ‚Äúlaunch,‚Äù or ‚Äúpublish.‚Äù



- For example, the area of our lives called ‚ÄúFinances‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have a definite end date. It‚Äôs something that we will have to think about and manage, in one way or another, for as long as we live. It doesn‚Äôt have a final objective.


- While there is no goal to reach, there is a standard that you want to uphold in each of these areas. For finances, that standard may be that you always pay your bills on time and provide for your family‚Äôs basic needs. For health, it may be that you exercise a certain number of times per week and keep your cholesterol below a certain number. For family, it may be that you spend quality time with them every evening and on the weekend.


- Projects that are completed or canceled Areas of responsibility that you are no longer committed to maintaining (such as when a relationship ends or after moving out of your apartment) Resources that are no longer relevant (hobbies you lose interest in or subjects you no longer care about)



- it‚Äôs so important to separate capture and organize into two distinct steps: ‚Äúkeeping what resonates‚Äù in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term. Most notes apps have an ‚Äúinbox‚Äù or ‚Äúdaily notes‚Äù section where new notes you‚Äôve captured are saved until you can revisit them and decide where they belong. Think of it as a waiting area where new ideas live until you are ready to digest them into your Second Brain.


- move quickly and touch lightly.

- **Section 6 Distill - Find the Essence

- He started with an initial read of the entire novel, noting down anything that stuck out to him: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important to put your impressions down on the first reading because those are the initial instincts about what you thought was good or what you didn‚Äôt understand or what you thought was bad.‚Äù


- Coppola then began to add his own interpretations, distilling and reconstituting his own version of the story. He broke down each scene according to five key criteria: a synopsis (or summary) of the scene; the historical context; the imagery and tone for the ‚Äúlook and feel‚Äù of a scene; the core intention; and any potential pitfalls to avoid. In his own words, ‚ÄúI endeavored to distill the essence of each scene into a sentence, expressing in a few words what the point of the scene was.‚Äù


- Progressive Summarization is the technique I teach to distill notes down to their most important points. It is a simple process of taking the raw notes you‚Äôve captured and organized and distilling them into usable material that can directly inform a current project.


- The technique is simple: you highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of those highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several ‚Äúlayers.‚Äù Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart.



- I read the article and highlighted the passages I found most interesting


- This is what I call ‚Äúlayer one‚Äù‚Äîthe chunks of text initially captured in my notes. Notice that I didn‚Äôt save the entire article‚Äîonly a few key excerpts.* By limiting what I keep to only the best, most important, most relevant parts, I‚Äôm making all the subsequent steps of organizing, distilling, and expressing much easier


- All I have to do is bold the main points within the note. This could include keywords that provide hints of what this text is about, phrases that capture what the original author was trying to say, or sentences that especially resonated with me even if I can‚Äôt explain why


- For those notes that are especially long, interesting, or valuable, it is sometimes worth adding a third layer of highlighting. I advise using the ‚Äúhighlighting‚Äù feature offered by most notes apps,


- highlight only the most interesting and surprising of those points. This will often amount to just one or two sentences that encapsulate the message of the original source



- There is one more layer we can add, though it is quite rarely needed. For only the very few sources that are truly unique and valuable, I‚Äôll add an ‚Äúexecutive summary‚Äù at the top of the note with a few bullet points summarizing the article in my own words. The best sign that a fourth layer is needed is when I find myself visiting a note again and again, clearly indicating that it is one of the cornerstones of my thinking


- I recommend using bullet points to encourage yourself to make this executive summary succinct. Use your own words, define any unusual terms you‚Äôre using, and think about how your future self, who may not remember anything about this source, might interpret what you‚Äôre writing.

- Progressive Summarization helps you focus on the content and the presentation of your notes,* instead of spending too much time on labeling, tagging, linking, or other advanced features offered by many information management tools

- Progressive Summarization is not a method for remembering as much as possible‚Äîit is a method for forgetting as much as possible. As you distill your ideas, they naturally improve, because when you drop the merely good parts, the great parts can shine more brightly. To be clear, it takes skill and courage to let the details fall away.


- If you‚Äôre going to capture everything, you might as well capture nothing.


- A helpful rule of thumb is that each layer of highlighting should include no more than 10‚Äì20 percent of the previous layer


- When should I be doing this highlighting?‚Äù The answer is that you should do it when you‚Äôre getting ready to create something.


- Start by saving only the best excerpts from that piece of content in a new note, either using copy-paste or a capture tool. This is layer one, the initial excerpts you save in your Second Brain. Next, read through the excerpts, bolding the main points and most important takeaways


- Now read through only the bolded passages, and highlight (or, if your notes app doesn‚Äôt have a highlighting feature, underline) the best of the best passages.


- The true test of whether a note you‚Äôve created is discoverable is whether you can get the gist of it at a glance. Put it aside for a few days and set a reminder to revisit it once you‚Äôve forgotten most of the details. When you come back to it, give yourself no more than thirty seconds and see if you can rapidly get up to speed on what it‚Äôs about using the highlights you previously made. You‚Äôll quickly be able to tell if you‚Äôve added too many highlights or too few.

**Section 7 Express‚ÄîShow Your Work**

- Those four retrieval methods are: Search Browsing Tags Serendipity

- Reframing your productivity in terms of Intermediate Packets is a major step toward this turning point. Instead of thinking of your job in terms of tasks , which always require you to be there, personally, doing everything yourself, you will start to think in terms of assets and building blocks that you can assemble. As the potential of your intellectual assets becomes apparent, you‚Äôll start to look for any way to spend your time creating such assets and avoid one-off tasks whenever possible


- Verum ipsum factum (‚ÄúWe only know what we make‚Äù)


- Use what you have; even if it seems meager, it may be magic in your hands.‚Äù

- That system is your Second Brain, and the small pieces of work-in-process it contains I call ‚ÄúIntermediate Packets.‚Äù Intermediate Packets are the concrete, individual building blocks that make up your work.* For example, a set of notes from a team meeting, a list of relevant research findings, a brainstorm with collaborators, a slide deck analyzing the market


- Like LEGO blocks, the more pieces you have, the easier it is to build something interesting. Imagine that instead of starting your next project with a blank slate, you started with a set of building blocks‚Äîresearch findings, web clippings, PDF highlights, book notes, back-of-the-envelope sketches‚Äîthat represent your long-term effort to make sense of your field, your industry, and the world at large.


- If you‚Äôre reading how-to articles in your free time, you can save the best tips in your notes and turn them into distilled notes for when it‚Äôs time to put them to use. If you‚Äôre writing an essay and decide to cut a paragraph, you can save those outtakes in case you ever write a follow-up. If you are in product development and create a detailed set of requirements, you can save that work-in-process as a template for future products


- Intermediate Packets are really a new lens through which you can perceive the atomic units that make up everything you do. By ‚Äúthinking small,‚Äù you can focus on creating just one IP each time you sit down to work, without worrying about how viable it is or whether it will be used in the exact way you envisioned. This lens reframes creativity as an ongoing, continual cycle of delivering value in small bits, rather than a massive all-consuming endeavor that weighs on you for months.


- Every time you make a sketch, design a slide, record a short video on your phone, or post on social media, you are undertaking a small creative act that produces a tangible by-product


- Journal or diary entries with your personal reflections Highlights or underlined passages in books or articles Messages, photos, or videos posted on social media Slides or charts included in presentations Diagrams, mind maps, or other visuals on paper or in apps Recordings of meetings, interviews, talks, or presentations Answers to common questions you receive via email Written works, such as blog posts or white papers Documented plans and processes such as agendas, checklists, templates, or project retrospectives


- Favorites or bookmarks saved from the web or social medi


- Your Second Brain is the repository of things you are already creating and using anyway. All we are doing is adding a little bit of structure and intentionality to how we use them:


- Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the process of retrieval: How can you find and retrieve Intermediate Packets when you need them?


- Search should be the first retrieval method you turn to. It is most useful when you already know more or less what you‚Äôre looking for, when you don‚Äôt have notes saved in a preexisting folder, or when you‚Äôre looking for text, but as with every tool, it has its limitations.


- Don‚Äôt take the work of others wholesale; borrow aspects or parts of their work. The shape of a banner on a web page, the layout of a slide, the style of a song‚Äîthese are like the ingredients you put in a blender before hitting the button and mixing it into your own recipe.



**Section 8 The Art of Creative Execution**

- Creative products are always shiny and new; the creative process is ancient and unchanging. ‚ÄîSilvano Arieti, psychiatrist and author of Creativity: The Magic Synthesis

- I learned that innovation and problem-solving depend on a routine that systematically brings interesting ideas to the surface of our awareness

- In divergence mode, you want to open up your horizons and explore every possible option. Open the windows and doors, click every link, jump from one source to another, and let your curiosity be your guide for what to do next. If you decide to enter convergence mode, do the opposite: close the door, put on noise-canceling headphones, ignore every new input, and ferociously chase the sweet reward of completion. Trust that you have enough ideas and enough sources, and it‚Äôs time to turn inward and sprint toward your goal.


- The more imaginative and curious you are, the more diverse your interests, and the higher your standards and commitment to perfection, the more difficult you will likely find it to switch from divergence mode into convergence mode. It‚Äôs painful to cut off options and choose one path over another. There is a kind of creative grief in watching an idea that you know is full of potential get axed from a script or a story. This is what makes creative work challenging.


- To create an Archipelago of Ideas , you divergently gather a group of ideas, sources, or points that will form the backbone of your essay, presentation, or deliverable. Once you have a critical mass of ideas to work with, you switch decisively into convergence mode and link them together in an order that makes sense.


- The Archipelago of Ideas technique is a contemporary reinvention of the age-old practice of outlining‚Äîlaying out the points you want to include up front, so that when it comes time to execute all you have to do is string them together.


- The goal of an archipelago is that instead of sitting down to a blank page or screen and stressing out about where to begin, you start with a series of small stepping-stones to guide your efforts. First you select the points and ideas you want to include in your outline, and then in a separate step, you rearrange and sequence them into an order that flows logically. This makes both of those steps far more efficient, less taxing, and less vulnerable to interruption.


- Hemingway Bridge.‚Äù He would always end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story. Instead of exhausting every last idea and bit of energy, he would stop when the next plot point became clear. This meant that the next time he sat down to work on his story, he knew exactly where to start. He built himself a bridge to the next day, using today‚Äôs energy and momentum to fuel tomorrow‚Äôs writing.*


- Write down ideas for next steps: At the end of a work session, write down what you think the next steps could be for the next one. Write down the current status: This could include your current biggest challenge, most important open question, or future roadblocks you expect. Write down any details you have in mind that are likely to be forgotten once you step away: Such as details about the characters in your story, the pitfalls of the event you‚Äôre planning, or the subtle considerations of the product you‚Äôre designing.


- Write out your intention for the next work session: Set an intention for what you plan on tackling next, the problem you intend to solve, or a certain milestone you want to reach.


- Dialing Down the Scope recognizes that not all the parts of a given project are equally important. By dropping or reducing or postponing the least important parts, we can unblock ourselves and move forward even when time is scarce.


- Start by picking one project you want to move forward on. It could be one you identified in Chapter 5 , when I asked you to make folders for each active project. It could alternatively be something you know you want to (or have to) get started on. The more uncertain, new, or challenging the project, the better.



**Section 9 The Essential Habits of Digital Organizers**

- This is where the Project Kickoff Checklist comes in. Here‚Äôs my own checklist: Capture my current thinking on the project. Review folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes. Search for related terms across all folders. Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder. Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project.



- Depending on your profession or industry, you might need more or less formality, more or less time for a first pass, and more or fewer people involved. Here are some other options for actions you might want to include in your own version:


- Answer premortem * questions: What do you want to learn? What is the greatest source of uncertainty or most important question you want to answer? What is most likely to fail? Communicate with stakeholders: Explain to your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., what the project is about and why it matters. Define success criteria: What needs to happen for this project to be considered successful? What are the minimum results you need to achieve, or the ‚Äústretch goals‚Äù you‚Äôre striving for?
