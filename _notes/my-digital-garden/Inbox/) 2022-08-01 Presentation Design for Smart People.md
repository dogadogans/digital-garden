# Presentation Design Checklist
1. Craft the **narrative structure** of your presentation
	- Persuasive // Narrative // Explanatory
		- **Persuasive:** If you are trying to convince someone about something, then persuasive presentation is your choice.
			- *Used for*; pitch a product, propose action, change minds, make an argument
		- **Narrative:** If you are trying to evoke feelings and inspire audience, then Narrative is the right one for you.
			- *Used for*; inspire, entertain,  provoke thought, tell a story.
		- **Explanatory:** If you are focused on sharing information without changing people's mind then go with explanatory. 
			- *Used for*; lectures, teaching a process, share information, showcase your work.
	- Narrative arc determines how your presentation proceed.
2. Using that as a guide, fill out your **content outline**. 
3. Make a **visual storyboard** of your presentation.
4. Design and build your slides.
5. Choose a scripting approach.
	- **Rough Outline:** This strategy might not be the best choice for you if you lack confidence and worry that you will mumble a lot while trying to make your point 
		Write and print out your outline. Rehearse your presentation. 
	- **Slide-led Outline:** Make a note of what you intend to say on each slide.
	- **Full script:** Write everything down in verbatim. It's good for really high-stake presentations.  
6. Practice your **delivery**.

#### Persuasive Presentation Structure
1. *Set the Stage*
	- Introduce yourself; provide context, define question, hook your audience.
	- Establish the need for a solution or answer. But don't giveaway your solution here; rather use the intro to frame the presentation as the solving of a problem.
		- Hi Here's the situation
2. *Explore Evidence*
	- Build towards your solution with compelling evidence. 
	- A nice approach is to outline the criteria that would solve problem. In other words draw the boxes that your solution will "tick."
		- A good solution would do X,Y, and Z. How great those solutions would be?
3. *Propose Solution*
	- Unveil your solution and its benefits, or your argument and its key points.
	- If you can, try to address counter arguments in here before they're brought up by audience.
		- My solution does X,Y, and Z because of A,B,C. How cool is that?
4. *Execution*
	Outline next steps, show how your points has real world relevance. Call to action
		Here's how we make it happen.
- *Persuasive Presentation Example*: [Steve Jobs' Ipad Introduction Video.](https://youtu.be/Ndnmtz8-S5I)

#### Narrative Presentation Structure
1. *Context*
	- Before journey begins, set the stage, introduce main character. *Protip2*: After crux do here
		- Cinderella has a shitty life. 
2. *Catalyst* 
	- The moment of change. *Protip3*: After context catalyst and climb should follow.
		- One day a letter arrives about a ball. Her stepmother allows her to go if she can find a dress and finish chores.
3. *Climb*
	- Journey upside and downs, obstacles. 
		- Cinderella's animal friends help her to finish chores. But sisters ruined them. Fairy godmother to the rescue!
4. *Crux*
	- The moment what the story is all about. *Protip1:* Start planning from here.
		- Cinderella goes to ball, wins the heart of the prince. But has to escape before her magic runs out, she leaves but her glass slipper falls off for to prince to find. 
5. *Closure*
	- What happened next, what it all means, hopes for future.
		- Prince tries to find the owner of the slipper, and eventually finds Cinderella and marries her.


#### Explanatory Presentation Structure
1. *Set the Stage*
	- Introduce yourself, define topic, set expectations, lay a foundation.
	- While introducing yourself try to add your authentic voice and style. It gives them an emotional connection line with you.
	- Start strong, now is the moment to *hook your audience*. 
2. *Section A, Section B, Section C*
	- Deliver a logical sequence of information in clear sections with *clear takeaways*, all building towards a larger message or goal.
	- Why am I including this section?
	- Is there clear takeaway?
	- Is there enough context for this section? Will the audience be lost?
	- Does section and slide order make sense?
3. *Conclusion*
	- Wrap up, summarize your takeaways, show impacts...

### Presentation Delivery Practice
- [ ] *Persuasive*: Record a short video making an argument about something
- [ ] *Narrative*: Record a short video of yourself retelling a story. A fairy tale or summarizing a book.
- [ ] *Explanatory*: Record a short video where you explain something relating to your job or your favorite hobby.

### Business Presentation Checklist
- [ ] Does the audience know why they are seeing this presentation? Are there clear goals and action items? 
- [ ] For each slide, ask yourself: why does my audience need to see this slide?
- [ ] If audience can only remember 3 things from your presentation, what are those three things? Be sure to emphasize them. 
- [ ] What do I want the audience to feel?
- [ ] Do you have a clear takeaways of each concept presented?
- [ ] Can the progression of your presentation be summarized in a logical verbal statement?
- [ ] Does the audience know what the next steps are that need to be taken? 
- [ ] Where do my passions and experiences intersect?
