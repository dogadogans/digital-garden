> Success of our work depends on our ability to get support from everyone on the team, if we can't do that, our design will never see light of the day.

## Notes:

##### Preface
- The first thing you should ask when you have a new project is  *What are we trying to communicate?*
- The most important aspect of designing is that you should show client that your design is solving a problem for them. A successful designer should be able to answer their questions in a way that make sense to them, not to themselves. 

##### Chapter 1 - Great Designers are Great Communicators

- *Communicating about the designs was more important than the designs themselves.*
- Since design work is visual, people will care about everything you do. All of your work is exposed, so it will naturally conjures more opinions than any other areas in your organization.
- Key of being able to articulate your design is to understand the message you want to convey and response you want in return. 
- The person who can convince the other that they‚Äôre right is the one who gets their way. Your design might be revolutionary, but an aggressive and well-spoken salesperson is more likely to get support if they can convince your boss that they‚Äôre right. *Designers lacking the ability to explain why they did what they did end up on the losing side of the argument*, forced to make changes they disagree with simply because they were unable to fend them off.

*One Sentence Explanation:*
- You are only good designer as your communication skills, because if you can't convince people that your solution solves their problem, your work will never see the light of the day. 

- *What makes a good design good?* 
	We could debate the answer, but **when it comes to creating the user experience, a design is really only good when it solves a problem.**
	So, I would say there are three things that every design needs to be successful:
	1. It solves a problem.
	2. It‚Äôs easy for users
	3. It‚Äôs supported by everyone


*When working on your design ask yourself WHY?*
	-  When you‚Äôre working on a design, you need to make yourself *consciously aware of every decision you‚Äôre making and why.* You need to be constantly asking yourself, *‚ÄúWhat problem am I trying to solve with this?‚Äù*
	- The *best way is to write them down*. There is something about moving your unconscious thought to a more tangible form that allows you to remember everything you‚Äôve done. Because *you have measurable problems you‚Äôre trying to solve, write down the problem and then list your solutions next to it*. Do whatever it takes to document your own thought process.
	-  Make a list on paper of your solutions or even draw a story board that demonstrates the before and after effects of your designs The method you use for writing down your answers doesn‚Äôt matter. The point is to *get you thinking about your decisions in concrete ways.*
		- *Problem Example:* 
		- Users don‚Äôt realize the filter controls have updated the list of results because it‚Äôs instantaneous.
		- *Proposed Solutions:*
		- Move the count of items in the list closer to the filters so that the user can see the number change.
		- Briefly show a loading spinner on each checkbox as the user selects it.
		- Add a Done button that closes the panel to give the user a sense of completing the task.



*Write things down to turn visuals into a story that is coherent.* 
	- It can also be useful to describe your designs using only words. So much of our work is purely visual that it can be difficult to understand what that ‚Äúsounds like‚Äù in a world without pictures. Because our end goal is to tell other people about it, why not attempt to describe every detail in sentence form and assume that the reader doesn‚Äôt have the ability to see it? *How would you describe your designs to someone on the phone? Or by email? Writing down how you see your work will reveal many of your motivations, some of which you never realized were there. The purpose of this exercise is to help you uncover your thought process and articulate your decisions first to yourself.*
	- When we ask ourselves "How does this affect the user?" we often don't know the answer. We can only make our best guess, test it and draw conclusions from what we observe. 


*If we‚Äôre going to be successful at communicating with people about our designs, we must be able to answer these three questions about our work:*
1. What problem does it solve?
2. How does it affect the user?
3. Why is it better than the alternative?
	- Create bunch of alternatives, and don't throw them away. Make a list and think critically about your options and how each one of them are better at solving your problem and once you pick your design that you want a propose, think about how your proposed design is better than your alternatives. This way when your client ask question about your proposed solution, you can show alternatives and why you went with your proposed design. 


##### Chapter 2 - Stakeholders are People too

- See them as human
	- In psychology, the [[Concept of Attribution]] describes how people see one another, and specifically, how we understand other people‚Äôs behavior. Interestingly, most people tend to see other people‚Äôs behavior as a reflection of their particular personality traits, whereas we see our own behavior as being primarily situational. You see, we may have an unfair view of our stakeholders‚Äô reactions. It‚Äôs natural for us to believe that their personality (‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not a designer‚Äù) is what causes them to disagree with our solutions, but that‚Äôs not true.
- Create shared experiences
	- Finding common ground is important to earning trust. Most of the time the reason we can't understand the other person's perspective is often result from a lack of shared experience, we simply don't have enough in common with them. Focus on finding other person's **hot buttons** [[{ 2022-08-05 Captivate]].
- Develop empathy
	- Developing empathy for stakeholders means realizing their reactions and suggestions are based on a reality that, for them, is more important than our own, you not only understand their perspective but you‚Äôre actually driven to action; you want to make changes to your designs because you feel their pain. 
	- When working with executives it's good to focus on both what you can achieve in short term and long term to create buzz and keep everyone excited for the process. 
- Ask the right questions
	- Understand how their interests outside of the office affect their perspective.
	- You *don't need to be a great conversationalist to understand your stakeholder's need, you just need to ask the right questions* to make them feel valued and comfortable enough to talking with you. This approach helps you to build a reputation that makes want to talk to us more and, as a byproduct, listen to us more when it matters the most.  Also try to understand how they think in our work context by asking questions like "What did you think of the meeting last week?", "How's your work going on the other projects?"
- In addition to getting to know our stakeholders, it‚Äôs important to look at the individuals on our team and work to improve the quality of our communication by:
	- Identifying influencer
		- Every project has a variety of people who influence its outcome. To keep it simple, let‚Äôs assume that there are only *three main types of people who you need to understand*: 
		1. *Team influencer:* The people on your direct team
		2. *Executive influencer:* The people who oversee your project 
		3. *External influencer:* People outside of your team Depending on where the person sits in relation to you, it can be difficult to get to know them well enough to understand them and their perspective. But our job is to identify these people and seek to understand them as best as we can.
	- Building good relationships
	- Simple things can go a long way in establishing rapport: be yourself, do stuff, and give stuff. Communication is easier in good relationships

###### Focus on giving information that each person needs

 *User Stories for Stakeholders*
	- Writing user stories is a popular method for designers and developers to understand their users, but have you ever written a story like that for your stakeholders? As we seek to understand the people we work with, perhaps it will be useful to write out stories so that we can understand the project from their perspective. Here are a few examples to get you started.
	- Example:
	- As an executive, I want to see what my team is working on so that I can provide a report back to upper management.
	- As a developer, I want to write quality code so that I don‚Äôt have to deal with so many bugs or a lot of maintenance.
	- As a product owner, I want to make a product that is simple and elegant so that people will want to use it.
	- As a project manager, I want to meet with everyone on the team so that I can ensure that we‚Äôre on track.
	- As a marketer, I want to provide feedback on the product design so that we will have a product that is competitive and will sell.


##### Chapter 3 - Design the Meeting

- *Creating "Delightful" and "Usable" Meeting Experiences*
	- Everyone is busy and tired by the cognitive load they are dealing through their day. By eliminating clutter and options, we can help them to focus on goals and the real purpose of our meetings instead of them commenting on every single thing on their whim.

- *For meetings in your calendar* :
	- Include your own name or team name plus the name of the product, project, or part of the interface you‚Äôre presenting. You also want to convey the content of the meeting without implying the purpose is solely for them to give feedback.
	- For example, I will send calendar invitations like these:
	- Tom Greever, Case Study UX
	- Home Services + Concierge Design
	- UX Research: Search Insights
	- Homepage Content, UX Team
	- Include helpful information in the body of the invitation. An executive summary of what will be discussed, the agenda, and perhaps links to other documents. This way people have time preparing and have a quick idea about what to expect.

- *How to set the context of our meeting?*
	- *State the goal*
		- The first thing you should remind them about is your previously agreed-upon goal for this project or design. This should ideally be an improved business metric or the outcome we expect, but it might also be framed as the feature or output of your work. It may also be your answer to the question, What problem does this solve? Whatever the goal is, state that clearly up front before you jump into your designs.
	- *Summarize the last meeting*
		- Second, briefly remind them of the discussion you had last time or the decisions you made together. This can be a short sentence or several items, depending on the project. Either way, you want to quickly refresh their memory of your last conversation.
	- *Show a timeline* 
		- Next, create a visual that will help them understand where you are in the process of your design. Typically, you can express this as a horizontal line where the left side is the starting point (research, low-fidelity mockups) and the right side is the finished design (high fidelity, ready to ship). Highlight where you are on this spectrum and the level of fidelity of designs they can expect to see.
	- *Specify the feedback you need*
		- Also, tell them the kinds of feedback that are helpful at this stage in the project and what feedback is not needed yet. For instance, you might expect feedback on the overall layout and concept, but it‚Äôs too early for them to comment on specific copy or colors. Helping them understand what feedback is most valuable will help you guide the conversation in a productive way
	- *State the goal, again*
		- Lastly, restate the goal. It‚Äôs important that we are always on the same page about the problem we‚Äôre solving. Conversations get derailed when people fail to remember the goal or the goal has changed without us realizing it. Repeating it will reinforce this and help everyone remember what we‚Äôre here to accomplish.
		- Setting the context doesn‚Äôt have to be time-consuming. It can be done in a few short sentences or with a single slide. For less formal design reviews, I try to at least make myself a few bullets as talking points to cover these. For official presentations involving more people, I may have as many as three slides dedicated to this. The priority is making sure the people I‚Äôm talking with understand why we‚Äôre here so we can have a productive conversation.

- During the meeting *repeat the goal or the problem we're trying to solve and decision we made to make it stick*.
- Stakeholders can be distracted by small unrelated problems such as use of a color, copy of a text that doesn't match with the context. Your job is to make sure which bits your stakeholders are distracted by and eliminate them to create the right environment for design discussions. This way everyone can focus on the real issues regarding the effectiveness of your designs. *((Chippin team getting obsessed over the small details while we were focusing on the general concept of the app.))*

- In the same way that we create *a flow for our users through the application, we also want to curate the flow of our design discussion. Now match up those needs with the people in the room*. For each person, ask yourself:
	- What do they care about the most?
	- What are their personal goals for this design?
	- What do I already know they want or don‚Äôt want?
- After thinking about these questions try to come one with  list of questions and objections these stakeholders might have. This way you'll be more prepared for your reply. 
	- Example: 
		- Does the carousel advance automatically? (Justin)
		- The utility nav is too crowded. (Kristen)

- *Practice aloud like an actor*
	- Practicing for your meeting is usability test of being articulate. =optimize the flow of your conversation and test your assumptions even before the meeting begins. Ask yourself mock questions to test yourself.=
	- Also, design decisions can be particularly difficult to understand and there may be underlying reasons for your choices that you haven‚Äôt even uncovered yet. I‚Äôve found that I can identify some of my own motivations for design simply by talking out loud to myself.


- *For asynchronous communication*
	- When you don't get together with your stakeholder, best way is recording your design presentation and sharing that video instead of static images and direct messages.
	- Tips for recording the video:
		- Write a short script so you know what to say, but don‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre reading.
		- Keep it short. 2¬Ω minutes is the perfect length, I‚Äôve found. As much as 5 minutes might be necessary, but try to keep it as short as possible.
		- Include a picture-in-picture of your webcam so they can see your face. Not all software allows this, but if you can do it, it will add a human touch that is beneficial.




##### Chapter 4- Listening to Understand

- Implicit listening is applying skill in understanding what people are saying without outwardly doing anything specific to demonstrate that we hear them. An implicit listener is one who can quickly organize what‚Äôs being said and derive meaning without any other external clues.


*3 ways to show stakeholders that you are listening them*
- Let them talk
	- Why? Some people just want to sound smart. It could be that there are other people in the room who they‚Äôre trying to impress. 
	- While they talk, present yourself as valuing their input by maintaining eye contact and nodding your head. Use their jargon. 
	- While you‚Äôre listening to your stakeholder‚Äôs feedback, *work to uncover the real problem they‚Äôre trying to solve*. Often, our stakeholders see a need that isn‚Äôt being met with our designs, and they may express it with a suggestion that isn‚Äôt the right solution. So, don‚Äôt focus on what they think needs to be changed or the specific words they use; instead, focus on the underlying problem they‚Äôre trying to solve by suggesting that change.
		- We can help our stakeholders understand the real problem by asking questions and repeating it back to them. It‚Äôs okay to ask them directly, *‚ÄúWhat problem are you trying to solve by suggesting this?‚Äù*
- Pause before answering them.
	- One last implicit listening technique is mastering the art of the pause‚Äî when you think your stakeholders are done talking, just wait. Don‚Äôt immediately jump in with your response. Instead, pause for several seconds.
- Take notes while listening them
	- Taking notes is the only way you‚Äôre going to remember what was discussed and create a history that will help you to avoid the same conversations again in the future.
	- When it comes to design, notes are critical because opinions and ideas about the right decision will change over time. If you don‚Äôt have notes, you don‚Äôt have a paper trail to understand what logic went into the original decisions. You only have ‚Äúhe said, she said‚Äù and a bunch of rehashed conversations.

- *How to take better notes*
	1. Make it accessible
		- Everyone can see or has access to them. This might be a wiki page in your project‚Äôs repo, a separate page on your design mockups, or a shared folder or document.
	2. Organized
		- Write your notes within each agenda item so that it stays connected to the design in question. Usually, this would be by page, UI control, or interaction.
	3. Specific
		- Write down the names of people who make the suggestion you‚Äôre noting as well as the names of people who agree or disagree. This is not always an exact science, but something as simple as ‚ÄúCynthia suggests changing the color; Brian isn‚Äôt sure‚Äù is useful later when you‚Äôre trying to remember who was responsible for suggesting the change.
	4. Definitive
		- When a decision is made, make that explicitly clear so that you can find it later if you need to remember it, for example, ‚ÄúFinal: drop-down control should be a pop-over menu.‚Äù Items that are still undecided should also be marked so that you can follow up on them later. I add a question mark to anything pending a decision: ‚ÄúReconsider placement of sort options (?)‚Äù
	5. Actionable
		- Writing down ideas is useful, but if there‚Äôs no action, there is almost no point. For example: ‚ÄúTo do: update prototype w/ new control,‚Äù or better, ‚ÄúChad to update prototype w/ new control.‚Äù If there is a lot of follow-up to be done, it might be useful to create a separate section in your notes just for documenting it so that you don‚Äôt miss it in the list of other notes. I often create a separate heading below the agenda called ‚ÄúFollow-Up.‚Äù
	6. Referenced
		- Add links, URLs, screenshots, or other reference material to your notes so that it‚Äôs easier to communicate what the point of the discussion was.
	7. Forward-looking
		- I do this by simply adding a new heading in my notes called ‚ÄúNext Meeting.‚Äù Having this real estate set aside gives me a place I can quickly organize discussion that might be off topic and note it for the next time around.


- *Not just record what decisions made but also why we made them*. It'll help you to remember how you arrived at the solution in the first place.
	Including the why can be as simple as a single phrase or sentence. It shouldn‚Äôt be long or detailed‚Äîjust enough to help you remember why you did what you did:
	- Button color changing to red to accommodate newest brand standards
	-  Animation is being removed because it is too distracting
	-  This feature is deprioritized based on Karen‚Äôs meeting with executive team

Common questions to understand stakeholders suggestions or feedback:
- What problem are you trying to solve?
- What are the advantages of doing it this way?
- What do you suggest?\
- How will this affect our goals?
	- Stakeholders often have our goals in mind, but they don‚Äôt always realize how what they‚Äôre saying is connected to them. You want them to directly connect your designs to the goals every time.
- Where have you seen this before?

- *Convert "Likes" to "Works"*
	- The most important way we can do this is to help our clients move from talking about what they like and don‚Äôt like (which are their preferences) to what works and what doesn‚Äôt work (which is the effectiveness of the design). It‚Äôs too easy for someone to say they simply don‚Äôt like some thing. A subjective response like that gives us no way to address our stakeholders‚Äô concerns because it‚Äôs not possible to tell them their opinion is incorrect. We can only have a different opinion. Instead, listen for opportunities to convert ‚Äúlikes‚Äù into ‚Äúworks.‚Äù Repeat back what they said by rephrasing the statement to focus on effectiveness.
	- To understand whether it's their preference or it's a business related concern ask them out loud why they think it's better that way. Hearing the question in the context of effectiveness, they often recognize that they're only expressing a personal preference. 

- You need to delete "like" from your vocabulary too. Always put emphasis on the utility and function of your design.


##### Chapter 5- Get into right Mindset


- *We're not here for feedback, we're here for facilitate conversation about design.*
	- We are there to lead a discussion on solutions, not cram our work down everyone else‚Äôs throat. We have to take what we hear, analyze it, process it, and turn it into something more useful. We should expect to take what our stakeholders give us, and deliver it back to them better than it was before. A mindset like this allows us to respond more objectively.
	- One of the barrier is us vs them mentality. We need to remember and reinforce that we're all in this together, headed toward the same goals. 


- *Leading with Yes*
- Leading with a yes means that you always begin every response with a positive affirmation of the other person‚Äôs idea or request using the word ‚Äúyes.‚Äù It is a mindset that this person isn‚Äôt wrong. They have just as much potential for good ideas as you, and they‚Äôre a valued part of the process.
- There are dozens of ways that you can lead with a yes without actually committing yourself to anything. Here are a few:
- Yes, that‚Äôs a very good point.
- Yes, thank you for sharing your perspective
- Yes, I agree that we need to solve this
- Yes, there are definitely some ways we can improve this.


One caveat is to avoid following the word ‚Äúyes‚Äù with the word ‚Äúbut‚Äù‚Äîit turns out that ‚ÄúYes, but‚Ä¶‚Äù is just another way of saying no, and most people will hear it that way. Even ‚ÄúYes, however‚Ä¶‚Äù communicates a similar feeling. I‚Äôve found that you can often just leave out the ‚Äúbut‚Äù or ‚Äúhowever‚Äù and the sentence still works. Instead of, ‚ÄúYes, but our team looked into that,‚Äù you can simply say, ‚ÄúYes, our team looked into that.‚Äù

As you develop your yes reflex, remember:
‚Ä¢ It reinforces that you‚Äôre all on the same team and facilitates collaboration
‚Ä¢ It allows you to be open to new ideas, even if you‚Äôre not sure how it will work.
‚Ä¢ It keeps the conversation open-ended, giving you time to find the appropriate response.

To get into right mindset:
- Realize that our role is to lead a conversation about design solutions, not receive feedback
- Give up control of the outcome so that we can allow other people to provide their perspective on the project
- Check our ego at the door so that we can be open to other people‚Äôs ideas
- Lead with a yes so that we create an atmosphere of agreement and cooperation
- Develop a positive persona so that we can win people over with our own unique style
- Change our vocabulary so that we avoid tainting our response with potential miscommunications
- Form a transitional phrase so that we can set the stage for what we‚Äôre about to say


##### Chapter 6- Form a Response

Goal of the meeting: to get support from them and agreement to move forward. To accomplish this goal, we can break down the response into several core parts. That logic will flow together and make it possible for us to present our reasoning in such a way that it will communicate the very best response

Define our strategy for responding. What will we say to make a compelling case?
- Employ tactics that will help us get there. How will we deliver the strategy? 
- Identify common, relevant responses. What key messages are important in our context?
- Apply a common framework and ask for agreement. What do we want our stakeholders to do next?

It‚Äôs important to emphasize that all throughout this process you‚Äôre going back to your answers to these questions and using them to inform how you respond to your stakeholders:
- What problem does it solve?
- How does it affect the user?
- Why is it better than the alternative?


*Convincing stakeholders with showing that you represent the user's needs.* 
	- When I presented this change to our stakeholders ((he added a done button to a filtering modal)) , I had to justify the addition of a button that seemed unnecessary and did almost nothing, yet took up space in the UI. The easiest way to represent the user in this case would be to talk about my observations in general terms:
		 - In our usability study, people didn‚Äôt realize that the search results were being updated automatically, so we added the Done button to give them a way to explicitly indicate that they were finished
	- What would be better is to present the same idea as a story (or use case) that describes a real situation for users.
		- People are distracted while they shop with the app, and they need to indicate that they‚Äôve finished filtering. The Done button allows them to do that and gives them a sense of control over the filters
	- What would be best, though, would be to tell a story of one user who makes a good spokesperson for others, using human details that encourage a connection to their needs
	- We had a parent using the app in-store with their kids. They didn‚Äôt notice the results updating and tapped multiple times, becoming frustrated. Giving them this Done button will make it clearer and show them products more quickly.


- Every response should focus specifically on the differences between each design and express why your own solution is best. More than that, you must show your stakeholders precisely why that is the case. Being able to identify and express these differences is an important skill in articulating design decisions. (Showing them why it's better than the alternative)

- 5 tactics to shape our response 
	- Now that we have our strategy well defined, the next step is to employ tactics to help deliver on that approach. When talking about design, I suggest five tactics to shape our response:
	1. Show a comparison
		- You want to take your proposed design and the suggested changes and show them side by side so that the differences between the two are clear. The purpose is to provide a visual reference that leaves no question about which approach is the best. 
	2. Propose an alternative
	3. Give them a choice
		- A third tactic is to give stakeholders a choice between something you know they want and the new thing they‚Äôre suggesting. You want to present their suggestion alongside what they‚Äôll lose if we go down that path. They have to make a sacrifice. This is very effective if the thing they will lose is more important than what they propose.
		- Example:
			- If we add that new call to action, it‚Äôs going to move the login form further down the page.‚Äù You know that they‚Äôve explicitly asked that the login form be higher up, and moving it could adversely affect conversions
			- ‚ÄúAdding that will require some time, so if we do that, we won‚Äôt be able to launch with the dashboard graphs.‚Äù You know that the dash board graphs are a priority for this phase and that by comparison the stakeholder‚Äôs suggestion isn‚Äôt as important
	4. Ask others to weigh in
	5. Postpone the decision
		- Finally, if all the previous tactics have failed to move the conversation in a positive direction, suggest postponing the decision. Before you allow your team to make any decision that will negatively impact the user experience, choose to wait.


##### Chapter 7- Choose a Message

These are the key messages that you can use to deliver on your strategy and achieve the objective. With our strategy and tactics in mind,
find the messages that apply most to your situation and modify them to accommodate your particular context. The goal for this chapter is to give you a list of common ways of describing design decisions that you can use and reuse at each meeting I‚Äôve organized them into four categories (in no particular order):
Business, Design, Research, and Limitations.

- *Business*
One of the best ways to make a case for your designs is to directly connect it to the needs of the business. Here are three of the most common responses for appealing to the business:
-  ‚ÄúHelps achieve a goal‚Äù
	- This one also can be your answer to the question of ‚ÄúWhat problem does this solve?‚Äù because usually the problems we want to solve with the design are the same as the goals of the project or business overall.
	- Example: ‚ÄúPutting ‚ÄòRecent Projects‚Äô at the top of the home screen will improve data quality because users will have easier access to keeping their data current.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúFacilitates a use case‚Äù
	- This might be the most obvious and common explanation for any design decision because everything we do is about designing around a particular use case, user story, or feature set.
	- Just as often, we try to optimize for one primary use case by minimizing and limiting secondary or edge cases. For example, although any user is encouraged to maintain their account profile information, it is not the main purpose of the application. This informs our decision to put account management functions in a drop-down menu rather than a large call to action. Noting these justifications can help you keep people focused on ensuring that the primary use case is always optimized even in the face of other needs and features
-  ‚ÄúCommunicates branding‚Äù
	- I often find myself justifying design decisions based solely on the branding standards of the organization. Sometimes, things are the way they are because the company has a specific image it‚Äôs trying to establish and our applications have to reflect this as well. This is more true with the use of color, fonts, or language than with specific interactions, but it‚Äôs important to call out. If you chose that style because that‚Äôs what the brand guide defines, bring that to the attention of your stakeholders.

*Design*
Often, we have design reasons for why we did what we did. I find there are three common ways of describing my decision for design reasons:
- ‚ÄúUses a common pattern‚Äù
	- Help your stakeholders understand that because this consistency in the experience is so important, changing an expected pattern in one context will have the ripple effect of needing to use the same pattern in other places throughout the app. It‚Äôs not merely an isolated decision. Using a pattern is helpful to our users, and it‚Äôs also usually cheaper and easier to develop for the business.
- ‚ÄúDraws the user‚Äôs attention‚Äù
	- The headline and call to action are arranged so that the user reads the headline first and taps on the call to action next.‚Äù
	- ‚ÄúThe containers overlap to give the user a sense that they are connected as they scroll through the page.‚Äù 
	- ‚ÄúThe elements are arranged left to right and top to bottom, because our audience tends to scan the page in that way.‚Äù 
	- ‚ÄúWe used green because green means go or success, and the contrast will draw the user‚Äôs eyes to that element.‚Äù 
	- It‚Äôs important that we help our stakeholders understand the relationships between design elements and user action so that they can see the rationale behind our decisions. We need to communicate that we‚Äôre not only putting things on the page in a way that looks good, but that we‚Äôre trying to draw users into the application and lead them to action 
	- 
	- with an appropriate placement of design elements
- ‚ÄúCreates a flow for the user‚Äù

*Research*
Using data, user testing, and other research is perhaps the most compelling justification for our design decisions. I‚Äôve found three common responses useful when research is used to inform our choices:
-  ‚ÄúValidated by data‚Äù
	- Using data to support your design decisions is the golden ticket to getting support because it is the most scientific way of demonstrating that your designs are having the intended effect.
	- ‚ÄúAccording to our analytics, 64 percent of users drop off at this point in the user flow.
	- ‚ÄúWe have data that suggests the phone number requirement is our biggest barrier to conversion.‚Äù
- However, you should always be prepared to provide the data that you cite even if you don‚Äôt have it on hand. I usually have the data in a separate file or report that I saw earlier.
- ‚ÄúRevealed in testing‚Äù
	- The best way to communicate our insights from user testing sessions is to assemble a set of slides with quotes from a few select users and maybe even a video clip showing the problem areas. Edit the video from the session down to a few seconds or create a highlight reel of the most relevant parts from the study. This demonstrates that you value everyone‚Äôs time by only showing them the important parts while also giving them the opportunity to participate in a real user session.
- ‚ÄúSupported by other research‚Äù
	- It‚Äôs common for me to cite other (often external) research that I‚Äôve seen when discussing design. I spend a lot of time consuming blogs, books, and podcasts. 
	- When using other external research to support your decisions, remember to:
		- Make a habit of saving research to a separate document as you find it.
		- Note the title, author, URL/source, and date.
		- Write a short summary of the post or a sentence about how it relates to your project.
		- Provide the list of references to your stakeholders when they as.
		- Find research to support other viewpoints for a balanced understanding.
		- Give your stakeholders the chance to consider it or respond with their own.

*Limitations*
As often as we‚Äôre justifying our decisions based on what we think needs to be done, we are also making a case for times when there are limitations that need to be taken into consideration. We can‚Äôt always do what our clients want, simply because of other factors that are beyond our control or because we‚Äôre trying to adhere to standards in design and programming. I‚Äôve found three common responses for dealing with limitations:
- ‚ÄúNot enough resources‚Äù
- ‚ÄúLimited by technology‚Äù
- ‚ÄúComplies with a standard‚Äù
	- Occasionally, what our stakeholders want us to do will go against the technical or social standards we‚Äôve set for our application. We want our app to work in all browsers, on different devices, and for all people, so we have to follow the ‚Äúrules‚Äù that are set forth on the development side. This sometimes results in making changes to our design to accommodate these standards.


##### Chapter 8- Lock in Agreement

Every response to design feedback needs to hit on a number of areas if it‚Äôs going to have the kind of weight it needs to be compelling and con vincing. For UX discussions, I have a useful formula to help make our case to stakeholders. 
*This is the IDEAL Response:*
- Identify the problem
	- We must always remain focused and ensure that our stakeholders are aware of the problem we‚Äôre addressing; otherwise, the con versation
can quickly become counterproductive. Very briefly state the problem that your design addresses for the purpose of getting everyone on the same page.
- Describe your solution
	- This is where your specific design can be connected to the problem that you‚Äôre trying to solve. Make a clear connection between what you did and how it addresses the issue. Without a clear solution, the design is useless and ineffective.
- Empathize with the user 
	- Stakeholders can forget about the people at the other end of our products. Our job is to represent them, to feel so burdened for them that we‚Äôre driven to action. State how your solution solves the problem for a specific user by calling to mind the people at the center of your design process.
- Appeal to the business
	- It‚Äôs not enough to just fix stuff. All our decisions must be motivated in part by a need to grow the business or organization. This is where you describe how your decisions are meant to affect goals, metrics, or key performance indicators (KPIs). Bring it up, tie them together, and demonstrate the value.
- Lock in agreement
	- After clearly making your case, directly ask for agreement from your stakeholders. You don‚Äôt want to leave this conversation open ended, without resolution. Ask them directly, ‚ÄúDo you agree?‚Äù Put them in a position of needing to respond to you, and keep the project moving forward.
	- 


To get agreement, you need to directly ask your stakeholders for their buy-in. The simplest way is to ask, ‚ÄúDo you agree?‚Äù Put them in a position of needing to respond to you before you move on. Further, it should be clear that you‚Äôre asking them for a specific response (agreement) and that you expect an answer

You need to be the one who pauses the chatter long enough to say, ‚ÄúBefore we move on, are we all in agreement to move forward with this?‚Äù Getting that verbal confirmation is important to make sure this item doesn‚Äôt come up again during the next meeting because someone forgot what was decided.

For example, ‚ÄúDo you agree that we should improve conversion by removing these fields?‚Äù In this case, you‚Äôre emphasizing and reminding them that your solution intends to improve conversion.

Now we begin to apply everything we‚Äôve covered so far into one coherent response, which:
‚Ä¢ Provides a natural transition using Thank, Repeat, Prepare
‚Ä¢ Considers our answers to the Big Three questions
‚Ä¢ Applies any number of the tactics necessary to make our case
‚Ä¢ Takes advantage of common responses to design considerations
‚Ä¢ Encapsulates all of them in the IDEAL Response so that we can get agreement and support to move forward

##### Chapter 9- Follow-Up Afterwards

Let‚Äôs quickly review some of the things you‚Äôll need to do immediately after the meeting:
- Stick around to chat with people.
- Follow up quickly with your notes. 
- Apply filters and remove the fluff
- Seek out individuals who can help you.
- Make decisions when there is ambiguity

As soon as possible (preferably within an hour or at least within a day) send a follow-up to the entire team. It doesn‚Äôt need to be written perfectly; the purpose is more functional than poetic. You need to follow up while it‚Äôs still fresh on everyone‚Äôs mind, including yours, before anyone has a chance to forget and disagree with the decisions they‚Äôve already made.
 
 The follow-up should include a few things:
 - First, thank the meeting attendees for their time and participation. People have other things going on, and we need to appreciate that they‚Äôre taking the time for us.
 - Second, recap everything that was discussed. This can just be a simple bulleted list with the decision noted. Having a simple list makes it easy to share with other people
 - Last, focus on actions, next steps, or expectations. You want to always (as much as possible) communicate what‚Äôs going to happen next. This helps people see that the meeting was a good use of their time because it‚Äôs moving things forward. It also offloads the burden from you and allows the entire team to participate in the next steps.

Example Follow-up Meeting Email:
Thanks, everyone, for your time today! It was a very productive meeting, and I appreciate you all being available. Here is what we decided:
- The transition on the homepage moves too fast. Jon is going to change it to 100 ms.
- The price for items in Best Sellers seems too small. I will check to make sure it‚Äôs consistent with the others and adjust as necessary.
- The category tree appears to be using the wrong data. We have an email out to Abdul to address this.
- Stan is concerned the CTA for membership is too large and uses  the wrong copy. Jennifer is checking with content for the correct copy. I will forward the usability study that informed this.
- The release date has been approved, pending QA. Jon is going to email us tomorrow with a status update.


- *Applying filter to information*
	- What are this person‚Äôs intentions? 
		- Some people are just throwing out ideas casually and don‚Äôt actually have any intention of them going anywhere. They‚Äôre comfortable with the idea that it never progresses beyond the initial suggestion.
	- Do other people agree or disagree? 
		- It‚Äôs often clear that no one else agrees with this person, and even if there isn‚Äôt a decision, you can safely move on without adding their idea to your documented notes. Read the room and make a judgment call.
	- Is this person influential or not? 
		- Some people are more influential and important to our decision making. Figure out who‚Äôs who and then use that to inform your decisions for following up
	- Is this person likely to bring it up again in the next meeting? 
		- If so, you‚Äôll need a way to politely defer the decision and follow up later. If you actually don‚Äôt want it to come up again, be sure to address the idea before that happens

There‚Äôs a similar idea called the McDonald‚Äôs theory, proposed by Jon Bell. If you‚Äôve ever had the experience of standing around with friends trying to decide where to go eat, then you know this feeling. Everyone is trying to be polite, and no one seems to really care which restaurant you go to. As a result, you all continue to stand around and not go anywhere. According to Jon‚Äôs theory, you should suggest eating at McDonald‚Äôs‚Äîmake the decision for the group‚Äîand suddenly everyone will have an opinion about where to go. Jon Bell says, ‚ÄúAnne Lamott advocates ‚Äòshitty first drafts,‚Äô Nike tells us to ‚ÄòJust Do It,‚Äô and I recommend McDonald‚Äôs just to get people so grossed out they come up with a better idea.‚Äù

Say something like, ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt hear back from anyone by the end of the day, I‚Äôm going to move forward with this design.‚Äù You may not hear from anyone, but sometimes people will suddenly have. It‚Äôs not a perfect science, but it‚Äôs a great way to keep your designs moving forward. Remember: do something, even if it‚Äôs wrong

The time immediately after the meeting is a great opportunity to hear what people really think
- The faster you follow up, the more you communicate urgency, value, and decisiveness. Do it now.
-  Filter out any clutter or unnecessary recommendations from your notes that you know do not need further action.
-  Stick around to chat, follow people back to their desks, and get the last-minute buy-in you need to move forward.
-  If there‚Äôs ambiguity, make a decision and communicate it to everyone else. That might be the only way to move things forward

##### Chapter 10- Dealing with Changes

Sometimes, people give feedback and spend an inordinate amount of time on a relatively small issue because it is visible and accessible to their understanding.

Painting a duck. According to Jeff Atwood, a duck is ‚Äúa feature added for no other reason than to draw management attention and be removed, thus avoiding unnecessary changes in other aspects of the product.‚Äù The concept comes from a story out of Interplay Entertainment. One of the designers on an animated chess game was tired of all the changes his stakeholder asked for. It seemed as if no matter what he did, they always had one more change. To avoid having to make more changes, he created the queen character and animations exactly as he wanted them to be, but also gave the queen a pet duck. The duck was obnoxious and over done, flapping around on the screen. According to Coding Horror, ‚ÄúEventually, it came time for the producer to review the animation set for the queen‚Ä¶. When the animations were done, he turned to the artist and said, ‚ÄúThat looks great. Just one thing: get rid of the duck.‚Äô‚Äù

Since then, the phrase ‚Äúhairy arms‚Äù4 has become widespread as a tactic for getting someone else to agree with you using purposeful distractions.

*When you are wrong and made a wrong decision*
However, something strange happens when you‚Äôre wrong: there is potential for that trust to be broken. The metrics don‚Äôt improve like you‚Äôd hoped, you miss a target deadline for the release, or your designs are found to be ineffective for users. It‚Äôs difficult when you express confidence in your decisions and then watch as your assumptions come crumbling down. Hopefully your decisions won‚Äôt cause critical damage to your product, but in any case when your designs are shown to not be the right solution, it creates a tension that can be awkward to handle. You have a choice: own up to your decisions, or ignore, deny, and absolve yourself of any responsibility.

People appreciate honesty more than smoke and mirrors. They prefer transparency over a cover-up. The way they know they can trust you is when they see that you‚Äôll own up to your mistakes. Honesty is truly the best policy. It may be tricky at first: it will create difficult conversations. But in the end, you‚Äôll almost always come out on top when people realize you‚Äôre a trustworthy person‚Äîthat even when you screw up, you‚Äôre there to admit it, fix it, and move on.

Be direct and clear about what happened. You need to clearly state, ‚ÄúI was wrong‚Äù or ‚ÄúI made a mistake,‚Äù but also be quick to get to the solution and focus on action instead of excuses. Tell your stakeholders what needs to be done to correct the problem and outline a clear plan for doing so. Most stakeholders are results oriented, so quickly admit your mistake but jump directly to the solution. When you make yourself part of the solution, you‚Äôre also making yourself indispensable: they need you to help correct this problem. And because the blame lies with you, communicating a sense of urgency and willingness to go above and beyond on correcting the issue will help establish the trust you need to move forward

*How do you know when you are wrong?*
The most difficult part of admitting when you‚Äôre wrong is even being aware that you‚Äôre wrong in the first place. It can be easy for our own arrogance to get in the way of seeing the problem. As designers, we see our designs as our creation‚Äîthis perfect thing that we made and are sending out into the world

How, then, do we know when we‚Äôre wrong? There are three red flags, and they all conveniently line up with the three things you need to be a successful designer. How to know when you‚Äôre wrong:

- The problem still exists 
	- While we try to solve problems, it‚Äôs not a given that our designs will always work as expected. If we find that the problem still exists, we‚Äôre wrong and we need to change something. I‚Äôve actually witnessed designers who were in complete denial that their designs were to blame for an unsolved problem. ‚ÄúI redesigned it and it‚Äôs much better now. If conversion hasn‚Äôt improved, there must be some other issue.‚Äù No matter how great you think your designs are, if the problem still exists, you‚Äôre wrong.
- Users don‚Äôt get it 
	Because we want our designs to be easy to use, we need to see that they‚Äôre actually making it easier for people. If not, we‚Äôre wrong! I‚Äôve worked with designers who were so convinced that their interface was easy to use that no amount of failed user testing would have convinced them otherwise. They usually blame the users. ‚ÄúThis interaction is common on mobile devices now. If the users don‚Äôt know how to use it, they must not be familiar with modern design patterns.‚Äù Guess what? The user is not to blame here: your designs are.
- You don‚Äôt have support 
	- We can be really arrogant about how elegant our solutions are, especially if we‚Äôre the only designer on the project. We feel justified that ‚Äúno one else knows good design,‚Äù and so even in the face of opposition, we insist we‚Äôre right. But when a majority of people disagree with your decisions, it‚Äôs a sure sign that you‚Äôre doing it wrong. ‚ÄúI know you all disagree with this decision, but from a design perspective this makes the most sense... ‚Äù Although we do want everyone to trust us with difficult decisions, it‚Äôs not true that you‚Äôre always right just because you‚Äôre a designer. Take stock of the room and be smart about how you‚Äôre perceived when you push for something. When you own the company, you can take those risks. But until then, allow other people to influence the project, too.
