## Notes:



**Chapter 1: Control: How to win the social game**

- HACK #1: The *Social Game Plan* Take control of your interactions and play by your social rules.
	- Don't act like an introvert if you are not or extrovert. You need to be your authentic self to find right people. You can get along with everyone but your goal is not should be getting along with  everyone. 
	- Find the places you yo feel good about yourself, don't go to a crowded party to hang out, and find new people if you hate going to crowded parties. Find your favorite spots. Vanessa calls them your *thrive location*
		- Here are some example location: Bars, restaurants, coffee shops, phone calls, e-mails, movie nights etc. 
	- Vanessa calls the locations that you despise to be there as *survive location*, these are the places you want a avoid because imagine it like if you are a great basketball player and all of a sudden they put you in a football game, no matter what you do, you can't thrive and be successful as you are the way you were in basketball field. That's why it's important to know your comfort locations. 
	- In social situations such as parties or conference Vanessa has a tactic about when to approach someone or avoid them. Here is the list
		- Approach me: 
			- I've just gotten my food
			- I'm close to the host
			- I have a fresh drink in my hand
		- Avoid me:
			- I'm only talking to people I know.
			- I just got here.
			- Where's the bathroom?
	- With this hack you are controlling where, how and with whom your interactions take place, you can set up yourself for more success. 
	- Succeeding with people is about engineering what works for you.

##### Review Chapter 1 
- Stop forcing yourself to socialize in ways that drain you. 
- Go where you thrive, avoid where you survive.
- Say no so you have the energy to say yes.


**Chapter 2: Capture: How to make a killer first impression**

- Hack #2 *The Triple Threat* Make a powerful first impression by nonverbally hacking all three levels of trust. 
	- People create their impression of you before you even start talking. They look for cues that are you a friend or foe, are you a winner or loser and here are three important aspects you should master to make them like you:
	- Hands (Most people look at your hand gestures when they see you, don't hide your hands, show them you are open to them.)
	- Posture (Use Launch Stance. Looking like Buzz Lightyear)
	- Eye Contact (When looking them, try to notice their eye color, hold eye contact for %60 to %70 of the time. )

##### Review Chapter 2 
- Confirm trust by showing hands
- Look like a winner with Buzz Lightyear stance
- Use eye contact with right amount to build connection.


**Chapter 3: Spark: How to have dazzling conversations**

- Hack #3: *Conversational Sparks.* Use unique talking points to create pleasurable and memorable conversations.
	-  Talking about something that other person has interests creates a spark. That spike of dopamine in the conversation, not only they enjoy your company, you also built a memory that'll remember more.
	- 2 ways to spark conversation:
	- *Conversation Sparks*
		- Sparks come from the novelty, so stop asking questions that boring and scripted. Go for interesting ones.
	- *Push Hot Buttons*
		- When you are talking someone you are looking for hot buttons, topics that are interesting and fun for them.- 
		- The moment someone lights up, you know you have just pushed a hot button. This is when you can ask for background stories, details, and dig deeper. That produces both great conversation and more dopamine, which makes you more memorable. Whether in person, over e-mail, or on the phone, looking for hot buttons is an easy way to spark interest.
		- Unique questions, unexpected stories, and uncommon occurrences keep us alert in conversation. In other words, being different wakes people up.= 
		- Think about how you can energize different areas of your life. This creates tons of dopamine-worthy moments for the people you encounter.  Don‚Äôt be afraid to try out a new joke, tell a silly story, or ask a nontypical conversation sparker. You‚Äôll spice up your night, add flair to theirs, and have conversations you will never forget.


##### Review Chapter 3
- Abandon social scripts
- Find topics that turn people on.
- Create sparks by using people's name, asking unique questions and bringing up novel topics.


**Chapter 4: Highlight: How to be the most memorable person in the room**

- Hack 4: *Be a Higlighter*. Bring out best in people by highlighting their strength.
	- People love to be heard. Once you heard them use your knowledge about them to highlight their strengths, celebrate them with excitement. When they accomplish something make sure to be excited for them and congrulat them w
	- Example:
		- You are so knowledgeable in this subject, they are lucky to have you.
		- You know everyone, you must be a great networker.  
	- You bring out the best in yourself by looking for the best in others.
	- The [[Pygmalion Effect]] myth is about the self-fulfilling power of expectation. Pygmalion created a blueprint of what he wanted and then it came to life. In other words, great expectations are met with greatness.
	- Being memorable is not about bringing up your high points. It‚Äôs about highlighting theirs. Don‚Äôt try to impress people, let them impress you.
	- Elevate people by hacking listening, highlighting, and expecting the best in those around you. Being a highlighter helps you be the highlight.

##### Review Chapter 4
- Listen with purpose - always search for the good.
- Be the high point of every interaction by giving people a reason to remember you.
- When you expect the worst, that's exactly what you will get. 


**Chapter 5: Intrigue: How to be ridiculously likable**

- Hack 5: *Thread Theory.* Find and follow threads of similarity to be more socially attractive. 
	- Imagine each person as a big ball of string. All these strings are their thoughts, ideas etc. It's your job to figure out which threads you want to solve and which part of that person you are willing to learn more about.
	- Every interaction should be about finding threads of commonalities. Every thread that binds you brings you closer to a person. The more threads you have, the more socially attractive you become.
	- If you can't find commonalities try to go for another question, don't focus on the not similar part. And once you find commonality, don't jump to next question, learn more about it and dig a little more deeper.
	- When you first begin in an interaction, I want you to try to tease out some thoughts you both share. The more threads you share, the more you will be able to talk about‚Äîand the more ridiculously likable you will be.
	- *Don‚Äôt fall into the ‚ÄúNot me!‚Äù trap; instead, find a way to say ‚ÄúMe too!‚Äù*
	- After talking about common grounds ask how you can help them with it or let them teach you. 
	- Bottom Line: *‚ÄúMe too!‚Äù* and *‚ÄúTeach me?‚Äù* are two of the *most powerful and underutilized phrases* we have. Use them whenever possible. Also you can tie yourself to them by asking simply *Can I help you with anything?*



##### Review Chapter 5
1. Don't overthink what you are going to say, focus on commonalities. 
2. Go deeper by asking Five Whys. 
3. Tie yourself to someone by making their problem your own. 


**Chapter 6: Decode: How to uncover hidden emotions**


- When you mention your six-week goal, you spot a microexpression of contempt. Typical Response: Ignore it‚Äîyou know it‚Äôs a tight turnaround, but it‚Äôs all hands on deck for this one. Six weeks later, you are surprised when your colleague says he is at least two weeks behind. Now it‚Äôs up to you to pick up the slack. A Hacker‚Äôs Response: Go into information-seeking mode and figure out exactly what your colleague is worried about. What are his expectations for deliverables? How can you re-evaluate to help him (and you) get this project done on time? Either decide on a new timeline or change the deliverables to be more equitable.


- Find the source‚Äîwhat exactly is causing this contempt? Re-evaluate‚Äîhow can you address the contemptuous issue? Build rapport‚Äîwhere can you agree?

Responding to contempt expression  
  Its not smirk its a prooooooblem



- After cake, you take your mom aside and ask her if she is excited about the iPad. ‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù she says. But you spot that fear again. You offer to come over in the next few days and give her a tutorial on the iPad. She sighs with relief. After a few sessions, she has figured out Netflix and her e-mail. You also sign her up for a free iPad class offered at the Apple Store. She comes back with a list of cool new apps she thinks you would like. Nailed it! How to Respond: Address‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the threat? What is the source of discomfort? Soothe‚Äîhow can you make it safer? Comfort‚Äîcan you reassure, re-evaluate, or remove the threat


- Microexpression: n. A brief, involuntary facial expression that humans make when they feel an intense emotion.

- During this interaction, Emily showed three crucial microexpressions: sadness, fear, and contempt. These were key because they were incongruent with her words. Even though her words said she was fine, her true emotions were displayed on her face.

- If you thought your average eye contact was below 60 percent, then reading microexpressions is an easy way to incentivize more gazing.

- Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs interesting about contempt: It confuses us.

- Contempt confuses us because we mistake the smirk for a partial smile or boredom, but that could not be further from the truth. Contempt is a cue of serious dislike and scorn. We often show contempt when we feel that someone or something is beneath our attention.


- The hypothesis is that our facial expressions and our emotions are connected in a loop. When you feel an emotion, it is expressed on your face. On the other hand, when you have an expression on your face, you also feel that emotion. This is a great ninja tip‚Äîif you want to really feel as someone else feels, copy their expression to glimpse their inner state.


**Chapter 7: Solve: How to crack someone‚Äôs personality**

- Getting the best out of people is like solving a puzzle,

- People come in a host of flavors, and understanding what flavor they are‚Äîand therefore what their hot buttons are‚Äîis necessary to lead and motivate them.‚Äù

- Ever wish your colleague was more organized? Ever try to make your partner less of a homebody? Ever try to calm your friend down from worrying so much? This never works! We can‚Äôt alter people‚Äôs nature. Instead of trying to change the people in your life, learn how to decode, optimize, and predict their behavior.

- Begin to practice guessing the personality traits of people you meet. I highly recommend the direct approach for this. I frequently ask new friends, new hires, and new colleagues directly about their personality traits. This is the easiest and most straightforward way to decode someone‚Äôs matrix. Here are a few strategies:


**Chapter 8: Appreciate: How to get the best from people**

- The first layer, as we already learned, is how someone falls on each of the five personality traits. The second layer is how someone expresses appreciation, and how they feel it.


- Social psychologist Dr. Uriel G. Foa discovered the resource theory of human relationships.4 He argues that all interactions are actually transactions. That people cooperate simply to give and take resources from each other. ‚ÄúA resource is defined as anything that can be transmitted from one person to another.‚Äù5



**Chapter 9: Value: How to get along with anyone**


- Killer social skills require seeing the world through someone‚Äôs lens besides your own. Appeal to someone by focusing on what they value, not what you value

- Complaints and Brags: Does someone complain about not being paid enough at work? (Money) Not being recognized for an achievement? (Status) Not having a nice enough car? (Goods) Or do they brag about how they took care of a sick parent? (Service) How much the new boss likes them? (Love)


- How much they know about the new corporate partner? (Information) We‚Äôre usually proud of obtaining our primary resource and upset about not having enough of it. This comes out in boasts, grumbles, and brags.

- Nonverbal Cues: Body language can also help you figure out if you are tapping into or refusing someone‚Äôs primary value. Think of our good friend Mario. When he gets a Fire Flower or Super Mushroom, he jumps into the air, gets bigger, or runs faster. But when he hits a Koopa shell or a Goomba, he shrinks or loses a life. It‚Äôs the same in real life (minus the overalls and mustache). When someone gets a primary value met, they are delighted! Watch for genuine happiness micro expressions, leans, nods, and winner body language. When someone does not get their primary value met, they show disgust, anger, contempt, or defeated body language.

- What keeps someone up at night? What do they stress out about? This can clue you into their primary value. Do you have a friend who is constantly moaning about feeling out of the loop? Her primary value might be Information. Do you have a colleague who freaks out over people‚Äôs titles and is always stressing about who will get the next pro



Me..  
My primary value is love  
Lmao sucker idealist online




**Chapter 10: Connect: How to speak so people listen**

- Remember: Your stories don‚Äôt have to be originals. Heard a funny story at work? Add it to your stack. Read a funny anecdote in this book? Add it to your stack.

- Think of three stories that you enjoy telling. Find the hook, struggle, and expressive words to best share them, and then practice them on a friend. Create a note in your phone or on your computer to remember great


**Chapter 11: Empower: How to lead people**

- Always use the word ‚Äúbecause‚Äù when asking for something. ‚ÄúBecause‚Äù implies purpose. Whether you are pitching yourself, trying to get a date, or convincing a friend to choose your

- favorite restaurant for dinner, you always want to have your why at the ready. We know from the copy machine example that even ridiculous reasons can successfully persuade people, but I want you to find powerful whys, like Mark Gordon‚Äôs passion for changing the future of education or Kiva‚Äôs goal of alleviating poverty. Here is how you can give your ‚Äúbecause‚Äù more impact.


- Typical Request: Can I have your number? Hacker Ask: Can I have your number? Because I think we could have a great time together!


- Give people emotional ownership over ideas, goals, and projects.


- Julie, you always pick the best restaurants‚Äîdo you want to plan the birthday dinner?


- Do you notice something else about these examples? They also secretly use Hack #4: The Highlighter. Skill Solicitation is a great way to emphasize someone‚Äôs strengths and use them toward a common goal.


- Typical Request: Can I have your number? Hacker Ask: Can I have your number? Because I think we could have a great time together! Customized: Do you want to enter your number into my phone?



- The thing for me is: Am I emotionally engaged in the idea? Is there something special about it? Does it capture my imagination? So everything that I do is simply something that turns me on,‚Äù explained Gordon in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.10 If something captivates your imagination, your passion, your energy, it is much more likely to captivate the imagination, passion, and energy of others. And isn‚Äôt that what we are all here to do? I believe everyone is a leader in some way. You can both solve people problems and empower people to solve problems.


- I always start with something I am passionate about, outline one goal, and then find a really smart, capable person to work with.‚Äù


- Leading people is about communicating a mission and then letting them take part in it. If you want to motivate a colleague, empower a team, or inspire a friend, all you have to do is figure out how to give them ownership.


- Why are reasons‚Äîeven illogical ones‚Äîso powerful? Humans are purpose-driven creatures. We want to believe there are reasons behind everything we do. Before leaders can inspire action, they have to get emotional buy-in.



- Tie to Them: The best ‚Äúbecause‚Äù benefits the listener. What‚Äôs the payoff? What‚Äôs the end result? What‚Äôs the advantage? Think of L‚ÄôOr√©al‚Äôs slogan, ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm Worth It,‚Äù which appeals directly to the customer‚Äôs needs.


- Tie to You: If something means a lot to you, or would make you incredibly happy, harness that authentic passion to create a powerful ‚Äúbecause.‚Äù Gordon believes fervently in equality and diversity


- You can also tie your ‚Äúbecause‚Äù to a mutual benefit, or the way something could help an entire community. When pitching Citizens of the World Charter Schools, Gordon underscores how raising future world leaders will make the world better for everyone. Of course, the schools help students and their families most directly, but they also benefit the world they will enter after graduation. Similarly, Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúThink Different‚Äù slogan is an appeal to both the user and the world to challenge the status quo.


- Line: Focus on someone‚Äôs skills to turn their emotional buy-in into action.


- The more you can allow people to customize a process or implement their own strategy, the better their participation will be.



**Chapter 12: Reveal: How to build lasting relationships**

- He has tapped into something I call the vulnerability effect. ‚ÄúSharing our most vulnerable stories is a courageous act that channels intimacy with others and builds lasting relationships,‚Äù said Warren. Revealing, as opposed to concealing, not only brings us relief, it also brings relief to the people who we reveal to.

- Trying to be perfect is not only impossible, it‚Äôs boring. Trying too hard smells like desperation. And staying in hiding is exhausting. Vulnerability is sexy‚Äîit shows we are relatable, honest, and real. That is attractive. And the science proves it: ‚ÄúA blunder tends to humanize him and, consequently, increases his attractiveness.‚Äù5


- HACK #12: The Franklin Effect Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for advice, share a vulnerability, or admit a weakness‚Äîthey bond you to people.


- Or kick off a conversation by asking for advice. These conversation sparkers work nicely: Have any good restaurants you like? I‚Äôm thinking about taking a vacation at the end of the year‚Äîhave you been anywhere great recently? I‚Äôm looking for a new book to read this summer‚Äîhave anything you would recommend? What do you think I should get my girlfriend for our anniversary? I‚Äôm playing in a new fantasy football league‚Äîhow do you think this season will end up?


- Never miss an advice opportunity. You get them more often than you might realize. Don‚Äôt miss casual opportunities for favors. When I go to someone‚Äôs home, I always accept a glass of water when offered. People frequently tweet me cool links of studies about people‚ÄîI almost always retweet them and thank them for the recommendation. Every few weeks, I go on LinkedIn and accept the extremely kind recommendations and endorsements people have given me.

- To double the power of the Franklin effect, thank someone when they‚Äôve given you advice‚Äîand show them that you‚Äôre taking it seriously. You‚Äôll make people feel validated, helpful, and included.


- Admit when you‚Äôre wrong Don‚Äôt pretend to know a band you‚Äôve actually never heard of Ask for forgiveness When you don‚Äôt know what a word means, ask Say sorry Be okay saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù


- In fact, when I share a confession or embarrassing story in my articles, more people read it, comment on it, and share it. It‚Äôs almost as if my admission of weakness makes people comfortable with their own weaknesses‚Äîand then they‚Äôre more likely to accept help. Luckily, I am always happy to sacrifice my dignity for the sake of my readers. Special Note: Some people suck. Yes, there will be people who won‚Äôt welcome your vulnerability. And yes, you might even get people who try to use your weaknesses against you. But you know what? I think that is worth the risk.


- We all have weaknesses. The right people will like you for them.

- Life is not about being perfect, it‚Äôs about living it your way. As Frank Warren likes to say, ‚ÄúFree your secrets and become who you are.‚Äù

- People don‚Äôt notice your perceived weaknesses as much as you think. Even if they do, your vulnerabilities are connection points. Ask for advice to harness the power of the Franklin Effect.

- Reading through thousands of submissions from unrelated strangers, Warren kept seeing the same narrative: We want to belong, and to be accepted for who we are. Here‚Äôs the funny thing: We are afraid that our secrets will cause people to not accept us. But oftentimes, sharing our

- secrets is the fastest way to find acceptance.


- Why? Mistakes humanize us. We all make mistakes, and we like people who are like us. (Remember Hack #5: Thread Theory?) Having above-average people skills is not about being perfect. It‚Äôs not about never making a social blunder again. Rather, people who have great interpersonal intelligence leverage their vulnerability.


- When someone does a kindness for you, they are more likely to like you.6 This is dubbed the Franklin effect.


- How can we use the Franklin Effect hack authentically‚Äîwithout just asking for favors from everyone we meet? Three words: Ask for advice.

- Asking for advice softly admits a vulnerability. When you ask for advice, you are admitting a gap in knowledge or a need for help in an authentic, non-scary way.

- Asking for advice gets people talking. Remember how much people like to talk about themselves? Rather than being a burden, you spark pleasure (Hack #3: Conversational Sparks) and have the opportunity to highlight someone‚Äôs strengths (Hack #4: Highlighter). Being asked for our opinion shows that someone values what we have to say.


- Asking for advice helps you solve someone‚Äôs matrix. When someone gives you advice, you learn so much about them. You get insight into their perspective (Hack #7: Speed-Read) and the things that matter most to them (Hack #9: Primary Value)


- Don‚Äôt undervalue unsolicited advice. The Franklin Effect is not just about asking for advice. It‚Äôs also about taking advice, help, and support when it is offered to you. We tend to be defensive when someone offers unsolicited advice. However, this is actually an opportunity!


- Following these rules will help you build relationships.


- Don‚Äôt worry about being the best singer, just commit. It‚Äôs not about the singing.‚Äù



**Chapter 13: Protect: How to deal with difficult people**

- First, prevent good people from becoming difficult. Second, stop difficult people from being impossible. In both cases, the behavior stems from one thing: fear.


- Low Road: This is the fast, automatic, primary fear response that helps us react quickly to a threat. The low road helps us survive.
High Road: This is a slower, more logical secondary fear response that helps us think through a threat. The high road helps us thrive.

One two way of thinking fast and slow gibi


- HACK #13: The NUT Job When dealing with difficult people, name the emotion, understand the feeling, and transform the fear. The NUT Job both prevents crazy and calms crazy. This powerful little hack is a simplified version of a hostage release technique taught by Dr. Mark Goulston7‚Äîyes, dealing with a difficult person can be like negotiating with a kidnapper. Let‚Äôs put on our big-boy pants.


- What is this person afraid of? The moment you identify the emotion someone is feeling, you open a release valve for their anxiety. Sound easy? It is simple, but for some reason it feels counterintuitive to most of us. Typically, when someone is emotional and we are not, we try to counterbalance them by staying calm. But this doesn‚Äôt work. In fact, it usually only infuriates an upset person even more.


- The goal of the understanding phase is to unpack emotions behind what‚Äôs being said. During this time, you are trying to: Get as much information as possible Help them process as much as possible Identify their primary value in the situation You want to find the answer to: What is this person seeking?


- In the Transform stage, you have two options: speed-read or use their appreciation language. If you can offer answers or facilitate a resolution‚Äîeven better! Sometimes, as with many problems, they cannot fully be ‚Äúfixed.‚Äù In that case, you are best going into appreciation language mode. You can at least value the person and make them feel less alone.


- During this stage, you‚Äôre answering the question: What does this person need?


- My favorite phrases for transforming: How can I help? What needs to happen for you to feel better? What role can I play in making this better? What role can you play?


- When you say no to the wrong relationships, you make room to say yes to the right ones. Here‚Äôs how to say no:

- If you get an invitation you‚Äôre not crazy about, sometimes you can make a counteroffer. For example, a friend of mine invited me to her birthday at a pool hall. I knew it would not be my scene, nor a good way to catch up with her. I offered to take her to brunch that morning instead, which worked out better for both of us because we got to really talk. You could say:


- Our gremlins give us social anxiety, make us awkward, and muddle up our charisma. They‚Äôre also largely invisible to us. We very rarely say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a bad mood because I‚Äôm afraid of being rejected.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI yelled at you because I am terrified of being criticized myself.‚Äù

- Your gremlins are not just distracting; they force you into survival mode. Have you ever tried to have an intelligent conversation when you have dry mouth from nerves? Ever tried to be funny when you felt awkward? It‚Äôs almost impossible. This is because your apelike Low Road is slowing down your clever High Road.


- Most gremlins are a product of not being recognized, accepted, or heard. You can quiet these fears by showing someone that you do recognize, accept, and hear exactly where they are coming from. This is done by the first stage of the NUT Job: naming.

- Once someone feels heard, their Low Road fear begins to disengage and the High Road starts to kick in.


- Note: Do NOT try to move onto the Transform step until you are fully done naming and understanding. If someone is still speaking in a loud voice, tearful or flushed with emotion‚Äîthey are not done processing yet.


- When you Name, Understand, and Transform someone out of their difficulty, you become their ally.


- When you value difficult people, they will be less apathetic, angry, and fearful, and more compassionate, understanding, and open. However, you will meet difficult people that don‚Äôt respond well to even the most empathetic tactics. Their fear is so ingrained that they become impossible to deal with.





**Chapter 14: Engage: How to turn people on**

- This is how you turn people on. You don‚Äôt impress people by mentioning your accolades, accomplishments, or awards. You impress them by mentally turning on their reward systems. Here‚Äôs the great news: Regardless of how popular you are, anyone can learn how to be more socially attuned.


- When we attune, we are more receptive to and more aware of those around us. Attunement is also about acclimatizing or harmonizing with the people we are with. This is the final hack we will learn:

- Attunement Turn people on by making them feel wanted, liked, and known.


- We are more inclined to enjoy being with people who visibly enjoy being with us. In social psychology, this is called the reciprocity effect.6 We like people who like us. We also feel the need to give back the kind of treatment we receive. So if someone smiles at us, we smile back. If someone asks us questions, we feel the need to ask questions back. If someone shares a vulnerability, we feel the need to share a vulnerability back. Every hack you have learned in this book so far was to engage the reciprocity effect.


- Start and end phone calls with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy you called!‚Äù Start and end e-mails with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you e-mailed me!‚Äù Start and end interactions with ‚ÄúI so enjoyed spending time with you!‚Äù Invite people to sit with you during lunch, and at parties and conferences. When people join your group, table, or meeting, make them feel welcome. As people leave your group, table, or meeting, thank them and tell them you appreciate their time.


- I hope it goes without saying that you should do this only with people you actually like and are grateful for. Attunement should always be authentic.


- You are in charge of how you want to interact. You have the power to be captivating or not. We are the only ones who can level up our relationships‚Äîso let‚Äôs do it!


- Specifically, popular people are more attuned to other people‚Äôs popularity.


- Popular people literally make us feel good.

- In other words, popular people are more attuned to social signals, social hierarchy, and relationships‚Äîand they place higher value on these cues.


- They call this enhanced social attunement



- I was so excited that I ran over to her and then held her hand while she picked the rest of our team. I think we lost in soccer that day, but I was on top of the world. After the game I asked her why she picked me. And then she said one of the greatest things anyone has ever said to me, ‚ÄúI wanted to get to know you.‚Äù


- We want to feel like people get us, like we have someone on our side, like a group wants to have us as a member. Making people feel this way is called attunement‚Äîand it is one of the most underutilized social skills.


- This is the only hack that should be wielded selectively. It is one of the most powerful tools for connection and should therefore be used only with those whom you truly want to build a deep connection with.

- First‚Äîand not all that unexpectedly‚Äîhe found that likable students tended to be more optimistic and upbeat, and had higher self-reported levels of general happiness. But then the results get a bit more interesting: He found that the most likable students also liked the most other people. Popular students showed their ‚Äúliking‚Äù for others through higher levels of friendliness and smiling. ‚ÄúFor females, number of smiles per day was two times more significant to their popularity than physical attractiveness,‚Äù wrote Van Sloan.5 The more a student smiled at their classmates, the more their classmates smiled back at


- Here is the key to being popular: Like more people. When you are with someone you enjoy, consciously engage the reciprocity effec


- When you are curious about the people you are with, it is easier to come up with conversation sparkers. When you are curious about someone‚Äôs motivations, it is easier to decode their personality matrix. When you are curious about your own interactions, you can find patterns to help you get better next time.


- Being curious about someone is one of the best ways to show you like them.


- What‚Äôs your go-to conversation sparker? Try out a few of the conversation sparkers in the next few weeks and pick your favorite one to rely on. Where is your favorite sweet spot on the Social Game Plan? Try standing in all three of the sweet spots and pick the one that works best for you. What‚Äôs your favorite story? Try telling your friends a few stories from your Story Stack this weekend and see which one gets the best response.


- From time to time I sit next to people on a plane or at a conference and they want to talk. Even if I am not in the mood, I know that if I want to have a good discussion, it is up to me. I can‚Äôt blame people for not being interesting or not being good to interact with. I take full responsibility for my interest. Even if I am different from someone, I try to learn from them. Even if I am not interested in something, I try to engage in a


- Don‚Äôt impress people; engage them. Turn people on by showing them you are turned on by them. Attunement is about allowing people to be themselves with you. And the more people we truly like, the more people who will truly like us.


- In Part I: The First Five Minutes, we talked about turning strangers into acquaintances, quickly building trust, and making a lasting first impression. In Part II: The First Five Hours, I taught you how to speed-read people in order to identify their needs and predict behavior. In Part III: The First Five Days, we explored how to turn casual relationships into lifelong relationships with stories, vulnerability, and ownership. Your interactions will only get better from here‚Äîif you put these hacks into practice. Albert Einstein once said, ‚ÄúInformation is not knowledge. The only source of knowledge is experience.‚Äù Reading this book is great, but I want you to experience it.
