# Ahoy, It's a me Doga!

I'm a UX Designer who is interested in learning more and evolving my interests within a open space, I have heaps of different interests but mainly my notes are focused on [[Design]] , [[Psychology]], [[Stoicsm]].

I use  [Bryan Jenks][https://www.bryanjenks.dev/]'s [[Obsidian]] template to collect my notes in a organized matter.

[[{]] *<=>* `Books`
[[@]] *<=>* `People`
[[!]] *<=>* `Tweets`
[[%]] *<=>* `Podcasts`
[[+]] *<=>* `YouTube`
[[(]] *<=>* `Articles`
[[&]] *<=>* `Papers`
[[=]] *<=>* `Thoughts`

To see the input by status, each has status tags denoted with a colored square that is elaborated on more in [[Tag Taxonomy]]. The whole garden can be explored from [[Map Of Content|Maps of Content]]
